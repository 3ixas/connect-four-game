# 🟡🔴 Connect Four Game

A dynamic and interactive browser-based implementation of the **Connect Four** game, built with **HTML, SCSS, and TypeScript**. This project was developed as part of my learning journey in software development, focusing on game logic, DOM manipulation, and TypeScript best practices.

## 🎮 About the Game

**Connect Four** is a classic two-player strategy game where players take turns dropping coloured pieces into a **6x7 grid**. The goal is to be the first to connect **four pieces in a row**—either **horizontally, vertically, or diagonally**—before the opponent.

This project was designed with a **mobile-first approach**, ensuring smooth gameplay across different devices.

## ✨ Key Features

✅ **Fully functional 6x7 game grid**  
✅ **Turn-based two-player gameplay**  
✅ **Win condition logic** – detects four connected pieces  
✅ **Draw condition logic** – prevents infinite play  
✅ **Mobile-responsive design** for seamless gameplay  
✅ **Hover preview effect** – highlights the current column

## 🎯 Project Goals

This project was developed with the following objectives in mind:

-   **Strengthen my understanding of TypeScript** and its role in frontend development.
-   **Improve my ability to structure larger projects** and apply modular code organisation.
-   **Enhance my knowledge of DOM manipulation** and event handling.
-   **Implement CSS animations** to improve user experience.
-   **Practice using Git and GitHub for version control** with meaningful commits.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Technology       | Purpose                                                     |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HTML**         | Provides the game’s structure and elements.                 |
| **SCSS**         | Styles the game board, elements, and animations.            |
| **TypeScript**   | Handles the game logic, event listeners, and interactivity. |
| **Git & GitHub** | Used for version control and project tracking.              |

## 🏆 Future Improvements (Optional Features)

These are features that I plan to implement in the future:

🔹 **Score tracking** – Keep track of player wins across multiple rounds  
🔹 **Sound effects** – Feedback sounds for piece placement and game events  
🔹 **AI Opponent** – Play against an AI for a single-player mode  
🔹 **Multiplayer Mode** – Online play against other players
