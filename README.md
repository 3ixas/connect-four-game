# connect-four-game

## Project Overview
This project is a browser-based implementation of the Connect Four game using HTML, SCSS, and TypeScript.

## Project Goals
- Build a fully functioning game of Connect Four.
- Practice using Git and GitHub for version control and tracking meaningful changes
- Improve my ability to scope and plan larger projects.
- Apply concepts learnt so far during the _nology training in a practical project.

## Game Description
Connect Four is a two-player game where players take turns dropping their pieces (red or yellow) into a 6x7 grid. The objective is to connect four pieces of the same colour in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before your opponent manages to do the same. 

## Key Features (in order of priority)
- [x] A functional 6x7 grid for the game board.
- [x] Turn-based gameplay for two players.
- [x] Win condition logic for four consecutive pieces of the same colour in a line.
- [x] Draw condition logic if the grid fills up with no winner.
- [x] Mobile-first design.

## Optional Features (if time allows or for implementation in the future)
- [x] Animations for piece placement.
- [] Score tracking for multiple rounds consecutively played.
- [] Sound effects for piece placement.
- [x] Win/lose/draw notifications.
- [] AI opponent for single-player mode.

## Technologies used
- **HTML**: The structure of the game on the browser page.
- **SCSS**: The styling and responsiveness of the page and game.
- **TypeScript**: The implementation of the game logic and interactivity.
- **Git/GitHub**: For version control
