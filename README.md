# connect-four-game

## Project Overview
This project is a browser-based implementation of the Connect Four game using HTML, SCSS, and TypeScript.

## Project Goals
- Build a fully functioning game of Connect Four.
- Practice using Git and GitHub for version control and tracking meaningful changes
- Improve my ability to scope and plan larger projects.
- Apply concepts learnt so far during the _nology training in a practical project.

## Game Description
Connect Four is a two-player game where players take turns dropping their pieces (red or yellow) into a 6x7 grid. The objective is to connect four pieces of the same colour in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before your opponent manages to do the same. 

## Key Features (in order of priority)
1. A functional 6x7 grid for the game board.
2. Turn-based gameplay for two players.
3. Win condition logic for four consecutive pieces of the same colour in a line.
4. Draw condition logic if the grid fills up with no winner.
5. Mobile-first design.

## Optional Features (if time allows or for implementation in the future)
1. Animations for piece placement.
2. Score tracking for multiple rounds consecutively played.
3. Sound effects for piece placement.
4. Win/lose/draw notifications.
5. AI opponent for single-player mode.

## Technologies used
- **HTML**: The structure of the game on the browser page.
- **SCSS**: The styling and responsiveness of the page and game.
- **TypeScript**: The implementation of the game logic and interactivity.
- **Git/GitHub**: For version control
